// This repo will contain DSA concepts, implemented using Javascript.

// What is a Data structure ?

// - A Data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.

// - It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that
//   can be applied to the data.

// Why learn Data structures ?

// - Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way.

// - To efficiently manage the data we need Data structures.

// - Imagine walking into the library only to find out there is no efficient organization of books and they
//   are stored randomly.

// - The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes
//   down to the selection of right Data structure.

// - Data structure help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory.

// - Learning about Data structures also help you gain a more profound understanding of things you are
//   already aware of.

// For example:

// - DOM = uses Tree Data structure

// - Browser back and forward button = uses Stack Data structure.

// - OS job scheduling = uses Queue Data structure.

// Course Overview:
